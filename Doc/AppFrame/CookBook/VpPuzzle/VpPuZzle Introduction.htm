		<h1>Pzl-technology - dll-based component approach&nbsp;</h1><p style="font-family: Arial;">
			VpPuZzle is set of agreements to build VIP-based applications on the basis of 
			the standard VIP packages placed into DLLs. The VIP package fitted to 
			PZL-technology agreements is named pzl-Component . The VIP project (executable 
			or DLL), which contains pzlComponents, organized in a special way, is named 
			pzl-Container . The pzl-container, which is the DLL, is named dll-container. 
			The VpPuZzle is created to work with the Visual Prolog Pro version.&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p style="font-family: Arial;">The pzl-technology includes:
		</p>
		<ul style="font-family: Arial;">
			<li>
			The set of packages, which support the pzl-system
			</li><li>
			Classes, which support the communication with the Pzl-system
			</li><li>
				The Elementary PzlStudio applicaion, which gives the possibility
				<ul>
					<li>
					to include the pzl-system into any application created in Visual Prolog.
					</li><li>
					To create the dll-containers
					</li><li>
					To create pzl-components and put them into the pzl-containers
					</li><li>
						to perform other activities, which support the development process.
					</li>
				</ul>
